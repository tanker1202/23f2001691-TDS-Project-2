# ðŸ“˜ AI Agent API (FastAPI + OpenAI + Heuristics)

This project is a **FastAPI-based API** that acts as a lightweight AI agent.  
It uses **httpx** to communicate with the OpenAI API (streaming responses token-by-token), with some simple heuristics and knowledge retrieval helpers powered by **DuckDB** and **BeautifulSoup**.  

You can query the API with natural language questions (like those from course sites or example prompts) and get AI-generated answers in real time.
